# The Game
* You get a field of squares in which a specific amount of bombs are hidden in.
* After revealing a square it can have one of eleven values. Among them are the values 1 to 8, a bomb or just nothing/an empty square.
* A value tells how many bombs there are in the surrounding eight squares. With the help of this you can determine where a bomb must be located.
* If you think you know where a bomb must be, you should mark the square with a flag by right clicking it.
